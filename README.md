                                                                  Midterm report
This report presents the progress and preliminary findings of the winter project titled Stock Price Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks. The primary objective of the project is to build a deep learning-based predictive model capable of forecasting future stock prices using historical stock market data. Owing to their capability to capture long-term temporal dependencies, LSTM networks are well suited for time-series forecasting tasks. This repo also includes all the assignment submissions given throughout the project.

                                                                  Work Done Till Now:

•	Ability to perform:
o	data loading
o	cleaning
o	preprocessing
o	visualization
•	Understanding of how stock markets operate at a basic level
•	Clear conceptual understanding of:
o	regression models
o	classification models
o	evaluation ideas like loss and optimization
•	Importance of time series behavior in stock prices
•	Ability to fetch real-world stock data using yfinance
•	Understanding that:
